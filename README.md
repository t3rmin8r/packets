# Packets

This repo contains some packet captures that I've collected over time and can share. You are free to use these, but should cite that they came from Chris Sanders (unless another source is specified). Take caution as some of these captures may contain live malware. They should be treated with caution, and might trip your antivirus when downloaded.
